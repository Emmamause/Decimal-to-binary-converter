# Decimal-to-binary-converter
4/9/2017 I made this to practice c++, I started learning c++ a week ago on sololearn, my only experience with programming before that was basic html, css and JS, but I didn't had much practice with it. My only understanding of algorithms comes from learning lots of math and physics. This took me about 2.5-3 hours to make.

5/9/2017: Made a reverse algorithm to convert binary into decimal. Made them into functions so it can be used for other purpuses, removed user interaction for now.
