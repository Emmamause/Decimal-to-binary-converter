# Decimal-to-binary-converter
4/9/2017 I made this to practice c++

5/9/2017: Made a reverse algorithm (by reversing the arrays it uses, both are binary bases, but one is in decimal form, the other binary form).Made them into functions (one converts a dicimal into binary the other does the oposite) so they can be used for other purpuses, removed user interaction for now.
