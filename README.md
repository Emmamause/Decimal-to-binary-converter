# Decimal-to-binary-converter
4/9/2017 I made this to practice c++

5/9/2017: Made a reverse algorithm (by reversing the arrays it uses, both arrays are populated with binary bases, but in decimal and binary form e.g. 1,2,4,8... and 1,10,100,1000...). Made both functionality into functions (one converts a dicimal into binary the other does the oposite) so they can be used for other purpuses, removed user interaction for now.

5/10/2017: Added user interaction and arithmetic operations allowing binary - binary arithmetic, decimal-decimal arithmetic. Only one operation between two numbers at a time for now.
