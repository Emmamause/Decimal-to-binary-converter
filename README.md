# Decimal-to-binary-converter
4/9/2017 I made this to practice c++

5/9/2017: Made a reverse algorithm (by reversing the arrays it uses, both arrays are populated with binary bases, but in decimal and binary form e.g. 1,2,4,8... and 1,10,100,1000...). Made both functionality into functions (one converts a dicimal into binary the other does the oposite) so they can be used for other purpuses, removed user interaction for now.
